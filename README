Client-Capabilities is a set of ASP.Net webforms controls that allow you to template content
so that the appropriate content is displayed to the user, based on the browser's capabilities
and plugins.

This uses a Javascript file called DPlugin that I can't find the original author for (and I've modified it since).

The default page of the project shows usage. None of the template entries are required.
